BLOOD. RED. SYMPTOMATIC. VOMIT ON MY BED. 
WELLNESS CHECK AT 2 AM BITCH THEY WILL FIND ME DEAD. 
I DONT LEAVE MY HOUSE I DONT EVEN LEAVE MY BED
OPEN SORES COVER MY BODY TREAT ME LIKE UR PET.

I LIVE ON UR LCD SCREEN I LIVE IN THE RUBBER 
CHEMICAL I HIT UR BLOCK AND ALL UR WINDOWS SHUTTERED 
TREAT ME LIKE IM SINGLE USE DONT TREAT ME LIKE UR LOVER
I PICK UP UR SINGLES AND I THROW THEM IN THE GUTTER 

NOVA CANE LOBOTOMIZE ME TEACH ME HOW TO THINK 
I KNOW WHATS INSIDE OF U ITS ALL JUST RED AND PINK 
HIT ME WITH UR BLADE AND THEN PUT ME UNDER COVERS 
WAIT UNTIL I ROT AND THEN EXPLAIN IT TO MY MOTHER 

TEACH ME HOW TO LIE TEACH ME HOW TO TRACE THE CALLER
I COME WITH A KEYCHAIN U CAN BUY ME FOR A DOLLAR
I GLITTER IN THE STROBE LIGHT AND I BLOAT UNDER THE WATER
I NEVER WANNA GO OUTSIDE AGAIN ITS FOR THE BETTER IM UR PET.
